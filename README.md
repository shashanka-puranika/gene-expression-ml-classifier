## 🧬 Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning pipeline for cancer classification using gene expression data. The workflow mirrors real transcriptomics analysis used in computational oncology research.

The goal is to demonstrate how high-dimensional omics data can be processed, visualised, and modelled to predict cancer types.

## 🔬 Biological Motivation

Gene expression profiles capture cellular state and disease signatures. Machine learning models can learn patterns from expression matrices to classify cancer subtypes, aiding computational diagnostics and biomarker discovery.
